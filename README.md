# ipx-server

This project is based on [IPX](https://github.com/unjs/ipx).

Bun is the choosed runtime.

The images generated by IPX are cached in S3.

Check the `.env.example` to know how configure.

Working in progress.

Contributions are welcome.

The docker compose version is based on a `traefik` environment and has varnish-cache as cache layer too.
You must set `ipx.local` as an alias in the networks section of the traefik docker compose file.

```yml
networks:
  traefik_public:
    aliases:
      - ipx.local
```
